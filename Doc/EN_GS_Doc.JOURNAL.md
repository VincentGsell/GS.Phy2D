This documentation was created with the help of AI (Claude).
This documentation was entirely supervised and proofread by myself.
AI proposes, and I dispose :)

The Pascal code, however, comes from my own work. It was analyzed by the AI, and the suggestions it made were validated and "distilled" into this code in a surgical manner. It (AI) was nonetheless key regarding optimization techniques (spatial hash).

The Rust code was (approximately 95%) written by Claude, asking it for a translation as faithful as possible from the Pascal code, but giving priority to performance.

I have reviewed every line of it, as I am in a learning phase, and it is incredible today to benefit from such tools :)

We shall see what the future presents us, I remain optimistic.
